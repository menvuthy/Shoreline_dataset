**Abstract:** For small and low-lying countries, having a thorough understanding of shorelineâ€™s position and how it changed over the years is essential for effective coastal conservation, management, and national land protection efforts, particularly given the heightened risk of coastal hazards and sea-level rise. This study presented an automated method for extracting shorelines from open-source satellite imagery in South Maldives using unsupervised machine learning. The method involves resampling the Near-Infrared (NIR) image to improve spatial resolution, georeferencing, and followed by applying the K-means clustering algorithm to distinguish between land and water areas. The resulting boundary line is then corrected and georeferenced to match the actual shoreline position and transformed into a smooth line using a new modification algorithm. The accuracy of the automated method was evaluated by comparing its results to those obtained through manual extraction from high-resolution WorldView2 images in Laamu atoll. This study found that the automated method produced more accurate results from Sentinel-2 image than from Landsat image, with R-squared ranging from 0.94 to 0.95, MAE from 2.34 m and 3.24 m, MSE from 9.21 m to 19.12 m and RMSE from 3.04 m to 4.37 m. This approach offers a quick and cost-effective means of extracting shorelines from open-source satellite imagery, enabling coastal engineers and scientists to explore shoreline changes at a regional scale with high accuracy while saving time, money, and labor compared to manual extraction or high-cost satellite imagery purchases.
